# Adding Bells and Whistles to the Training Loop

The main part used a relatively simple training function to keep the code readable and fit Part 4 within the page limits. Optionally, we can add a linear warm-up, a cosine decay schedule, and gradient clipping to improve the training stability and convergence.

You can find the code for this more sophisticated training function in [Appendix B: Adding Bells and Whistles to the Training Loop](../../appendix-B/01_main-code/appendix-D.ipynb).
